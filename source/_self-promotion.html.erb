  <h3>Learn to use Vim efficiently in your Ruby projects</h3>
  <div class="pro-screencasts">
    <p class="pitch">
      In association with thoughtbot, one of the most well respected Rails consultancies in the world, I've produced a series of screencasts on how to make navigating your Ruby projects with Vim ultra-efficient.
      Along the way, youâ€™ll also learn how to make Ruby blocks a first-class text object in Vim.
      This lets you edit Ruby code at a higher level of abstraction.
